## Problem

Legacy self-service portals caused user frustration and data silos. Citizens struggled to find the right services, and staff spent excessive time manually processing requests. The existing system lacked intelligent routing and provided no insights into service usage patterns.

## Approach

Combined AI triage with intuitive front-end redesign and workflow automation. We implemented:

- **AI-Powered Triage**: Natural language processing to categorize and route citizen requests
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design with clear navigation and accessibility features
- **Workflow Automation**: Automated case assignment and status updates
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into service usage and performance

## Result

Faster resolution times and improved satisfaction scores. The new system reduced manual processing time by 40% while providing citizens with a more intuitive and accessible experience.

### Key Metrics
- 40% reduction in manual intake processing
- 25% improvement in case routing accuracy
- 60% increase in citizen satisfaction scores
- 30% decrease in average resolution time

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4, Custom NLP models
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Analytics**: Custom dashboard with real-time data visualization
